# Linearity

Given a function $\mathbf{f}(x) \colon x \to y$, and some constant $c$, we can ask if it matters whether we multiply the input $x$ by $c$ and then apply the function to the result, or we apply the function to $x$ and multiply the result by $c$. That is, does this equation hold?

$$\mathbf{f}(cx) = c\mathbf{f}(x)$$

Or to put it another way, if we "scale up" the input, does the output scale up in proportion?

Also for some other constant $k$, does this hold?

$$\mathbf{f}(x + k) = \mathbf{f}(x) + \mathbf{f}(k)$$

If these equations hold, we say $\mathbf{f}$ is linear.
