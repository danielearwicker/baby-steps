# Vector composition

When summing several scalar terms:

$$\sum_i{x^i}$$

the result is a single scalar.

> Note that the superscript $i$ in $x^i$ is not a power being raised to, but an index for the summation. Superscript indices specify the row of a matrix cell, so this describes a column matrix, whereas subscripts specify the column of a matrix cell.

When summing several vector terms:

$$\sum_i{\vec{e}_i}$$

the result is a single vector. Combining the two:

$$\sum_i{\vec{e}_i x^i}$$

we have a weighted sum of our set of vectors. As a vector multiplied by a scalar is another vector, this is still a sum of vectors, and so the result is a vector. However, if we consistently use the basis $\vec{e_i}$ to describe all our vectors, we could in fact forget everything except the coefficients $x^i$.
