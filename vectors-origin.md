# Vectors all have the same origin

When visualising vectors as arrows, always think of them as being rooted in one spot.

When in physics we speak of a "vector field", that is, a vector at each point in space, such as wind speed and direction, or the electric field, we visualise arrows spread out over space. But the value of the field in two different places may be the same.

This is obvious (and less confusing) in the case of a scalar field, such as temperature. At two different locations in a room, the temperature may be the same. It's a numerical value that varies from place to place, and the same number may appear in two places.

But exactly the same is true for a vector field. If the wind is some particular speed and direction at two different places on the map, we say the vectors are equal: they are the _same vector_. It is irrelevant that they are associated with different locations in physical space. In vector space, there is one vector with that direction and length.

So when considering the space of all possible vectors, imagine the arrows sprouting from a common origin.

(The only exception to this is when adding vectors by momentarily picturing them positioned tail-to-head.)
