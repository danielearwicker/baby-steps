# Complex vector spaces

Any vector space is defined over a _field_. This is unrelated to the physics meaning of "field", a value defined at each point in a space. Here a field is any set of objects with binary operators for addition, subtraction, multiplication and division that behave like those of the real numbers, so $\mathbb{R}$ is a field.

But as complex numbers meet this criterion therefore $\mathbb{C}$ is also a field, and therefore a vector space may be complex, and have complex coordinates.

Even the simplest non-trivial example, $\mathbb{C^2}$, is not directly imaginable, because although each vector requires two coordinates, each of those is a complex number incorporate a real and imaginary part, so each vector requires four real numbers to describe it, and so $\mathbb{C^2}$ can be mapped to $\mathbb{R^4}$, which is impossible to visualise directly.
